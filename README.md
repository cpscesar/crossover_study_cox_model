# Cox Model Analysis Using Crossover Study Design

## Overview

This project is focused on performing a Cox model analysis utilizing a crossover study design.

## Features

- **Cox Model Analysis**: Implementation of Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates using the `lifelines` library.
- **Crossover Study Design**: Analysis tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of crossover studies.
- **Data Manipulation**: Efficient handling and manipulation of large datasets using pandas and numpy.
- **Normality Testing**: Utilizing Shapiro-Wilk tests to assess the normality of data distributions.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your data according to the required format, ensuring it is clean and well-organized.
2. **Running the Notebook**: Open and execute the Jupyter Notebook using the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook cox_model_crossover.ipynb
   ```
3. **Customization**: Adjust the code cells as needed for your specific data and analysis requirements.
